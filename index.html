<h1>June 29th, 2007: The iPhone 2G – The First iPhone was released</h1>
<article>


<p>This is the very first iPhone. It is sometimes referred to as the "iPhone 2G" due to its lack of support for 3G networks.</p>

<p>As regularly as clockwork, our thoughts have already started to turn towards the new 2018 iPhone - but before we get too excited about what Apple's got in store for us this year, let's take a moment to reflect on what it's released since the very first iPhone back in 2007 over a decade back.</p>

<p>It's difficult to overstate the impact the iPhone has had on the smartphone market: by eschewing the keypad for a touchscreen and adding advanced computer-like capabilities that hadn't been seen before, it set the standard for this modern device. "Apple is going to reinvent the phone," said Steve Jobs at the time, and he was right - but the original iPhone had no third-party apps, no GPS and no video recording.

</p><p>The iPhone 2G was a GSM model and dictated the future of the form factor for the iPhone.  Since its release, Apple has stayed with the same form, only making minimal changes. When it was released, it earned the nickname, the “Jesus Phone” because people were so amazed at its capabilities.

The iPhone 2G was released in 3 separate storage models – 4 GB, 8 GB and 16 GB.
